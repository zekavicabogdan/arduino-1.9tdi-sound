Simulating the sound of a diesel VW 1.9 TDI engine using mechanical relays on Arduino boards. Created purely for the sound and fun â€“ no practical application or purpose.

To build this at home, you will need: 
- Arduino (Uno, Nano, etc.)
- 2 relay modules (x2)
- B20K potentiometer or similar

This repository also contains a demonstration video and a tutorial video!
